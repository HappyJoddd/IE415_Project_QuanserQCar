# Quanser QCar Simulation and Control in Simscape

## **Project Overview**
This project involves simulating the motion of a Quanser QCar using Simscape, incorporating advanced control strategies like LQR, Kalman Filtering, and SLAM-based trajectory planning. The QCar follows a smooth trajectory defined by SLAM waypoints, adjusting its steering angle and wheel velocity dynamically for precise and efficient navigation. The system is modeled with a state-space representation and visualized in the Simscape Multibody environment.

## **Steps Included**

### 1. **State-Space Modeling**
- The QCar's dynamics are captured in a state-space model using matrices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- The system is verified for controllability and serves as the foundation for control design.

### 2. **LQR Controller**
- An LQR controller is designed to optimize trajectory tracking by minimizing state deviations and control effort.
- The controller dynamically computes steering and velocity inputs to guide the QCar.

### 3. **Simulating QCar Dynamics**
- The QCar's states (position, velocity, orientation) are updated iteratively using the state-space model and LQR control inputs.
- Simulation results validate the QCar's ability to follow the SLAM trajectory.

### 4. **Kalman Filter**
- A Kalman Filter is implemented for state estimation, combining noisy measurements with the dynamic model to minimize errors.
- The estimated states improve the accuracy of control and trajectory tracking.

### 5. **SLAM Planning**
- A SLAM-based trajectory is generated by interpolating waypoints, providing reference positions and headings for the QCar.
- The planned trajectory ensures smooth navigation and serves as a benchmark for performance evaluation.
